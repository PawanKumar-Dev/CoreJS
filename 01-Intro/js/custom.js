// JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers learn

// It program the behavior of web pages. Or Add functionality. Or makes page alive to say

/*
 JS is High Level and Interpreted Langugage.
 
 1) High Level: It means Programming Language is closer to Human language and away from Machine Code. It makes the language easy to learn and read. Other e.g., Python, PHP etc.

 2) Interpreted Language: 
        a) These langugages pass through a program called "Interpreter" not Compilers.
        b) These "Interpreters" run through program line by line and execute each command.
        c) Unlike Compiled Languages where a small change in program meant that we need to recomplie the program and then run it. Interpreter are flexible and meant we can make small changes doesn't need to execute whole program again.
        d) Since Compiled Langugae give total control to developer, they tend to be faster. Though modern interpreted language are very fast.
