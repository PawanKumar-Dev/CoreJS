// While Loop: In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.
// While loop is also called "Entry Control Loop"

// initialize the variable
i = 1;

// evaluates the condition
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);

  // Increase counter(otherwise infinite loop since condition is always true)
  i++;
}
